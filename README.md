## 2. About this project
#### 2.1 Description
Elevate your task management experience with this ToDoList web API. Effortlessly create, update, and organize tasks in categories. Secure your tasks with user authentication and customize the API to suit your needs. 

#### 2.2 Why?
The idea of this Web API is to practice ASP.NET concepts and improve software development skills, including new technologies and architecture principles. Therefore, I'm reading [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows) to understand what are the framework best practices and throughout the project I will introduce some discussion about it.

This side project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!
